                                <p>
                                    My greatest motivation stems from the personal challenges faced by my family, which have profoundly influenced my career aspirations. The tragic loss of my younger sister to cancer and my mother to diabetes and chronic ulcers ignited a deep determination to find solutions for chronic diseases through research in molecular biology and bioinformatics. These personal experiences, coupled with professional and leadership roles, have developed transferrable skills that will support my success in graduate school.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The loss of my sister to an aggressive form of cancer and my mother to diabetes has been a driving force behind my research interests. My sister's battle with cancer sparked a keen interest in cancer genomics, propelling me to explore the identification of driver mutations, biomarker discovery, and personalized medicine approaches. This personal tragedy remains a poignant reminder of the urgent need for advancements in cancer research, and it fuels my desire to contribute to this field.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Similarly, my mother's death from diabetes solidified my commitment to understanding the molecular basis of chronic diseases and exploring gene therapy and drug discovery. I am determined to contribute to research that seeks affordable and effective therapeutic solutions for diseases like diabetes, which disproportionately affect low-income populations. These experiences have fostered resilience, empathy, and a strong sense of purpose, qualities that will support me as I pursue a PhD in this field.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    During my national service or internship period at the Tetteh Quarshie Memorial Hospital, I had the privilege to participate in voluntary and community services like blood donations, health screening as well as health talk, and many more. This led to the realization that many people (thus, the people of Mampong, at Akuapem-North, Eastern Ghana) were having or infected with the hepatitis 'B' and 'C' viruses without their knowledge, since these viruses at the acute stage are mostly asymptomatic. Using these people as sample for the whole Ghana's population, then statistically, I can infer that about 65 - 70% of Ghanaians are having these viruses. It is known from literature that these viruses have greater influences, mainly on liver and kidney functions. In order to help minimize or eradicate this problem, it became part of my research interest to also focus on “In vitro and in silico studies of natural products as potential targets of Hepatitis C virus and Hepatitis B virus to minimize cirrhosis and liver cancer and promote liver health”. So, I can design drugs affordable, accessible and have the full potential to clear these viruses, for Ghanaians and if possible nation-wide.

                                <p>
                                    In addition to personal loss, my academic journey was significantly impacted by financial challenges. After my mother's passing, I became the primary support for my younger brother, while relying on my great-grandmother, a small-scale farmer, for support. During the COVID-19 lockdown, I started a mobile money vendor business to support my family and fund my education. Although the business was initially successful, it was tragically cut short by armed robbers, leaving me financially devastated, which further compounded my financial struggles.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Despite these setbacks, I remained determined to continue my education. I sought employment with the Ghana Statistical Service for the 2021 Population and Housing Census (PHC) as a Field Officer (Enumerator) and also engaged in tutoring colleagues in computer programming, as well as repairing phones and laptops. These activities helped me manage my debts. This period taught me invaluable lessons in resilience, resourcefulness, and the importance of perseverance as well as practical data collection and analysis on a large scale. Although I graduated with a second-class lower division and a GPA of 2.83, I am confident that my academic performance would have been stronger under more stable circumstances.

                                <p>
                                    My experiences in research, leadership, and overcoming adversity have equipped me with essential skills that are highly transferrable to graduate-level studies. My ability to manage time effectively, work collaboratively, and solve complex problems will enable me to navigate the challenges of a PhD program. Additionally, my exposure to research through undergraduate projects and my growing expertise in computer programming, bioinformatics, data science, and molecular biology as well as my laboratory skills from various internships or attachment have provided a solid foundation for advanced research. I am confident that these experiences have prepared me well for the demands of a PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology. My personal and professional journey has instilled in me a deep sense of purpose and a commitment to contributing to scientific advancements that can improve health outcomes for people in under-resourced regions. I am eager to apply the skills I have developed, both in and outside of the lab, to tackle complex scientific questions and make meaningful contributions to the field of molecular biology.

                                    Over the course of my undergraduate studies, courses that played pivotal roles in shaping my academic preparation for a PhD are Biostatistics, Molecular Biology and Biocomputing. The Biostatistics course exposed me to logical and statistical reasoning, Molecular Biology course introduced me to fundamental concepts such as gene expression, DNA replication, transcription, and translation, which are essential for understanding cellular processes. This course laid the groundwork for my interest in studying the molecular mechanisms underlying diseases like cancer and diabetes. The rigorous coursework and laboratory sessions helped me develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which will be invaluable as I engage in more complex research projects in graduate school.

                                    My introduction to bioinformatics came through Biocomputing, a course that exposed me to the application of computational methods in biological research. It was during this course that I realized the potential of combining programming with biological research. I learned to use bioinformatics tools such as PyRx and AutoDock Vina for molecular docking, which I later applied in my final year research project. This experience not only strengthened my research skills but also sparked my interest in using bioinformatics for drug discovery and molecular medicine.
