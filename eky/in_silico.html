                                    Snakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease that claims 
                                    over 100,000 human lives each year around the world. Although some 
                                    medicinal plants are used to treat snakebite envenomation, little is 
                                    known about their pharmacological and biochemical efficacy.  In this 
                                    study, twenty bioactive compounds (ligands) of Azadirachta indica 
                                    (neem) were analysed for their inhibitory effects on Phospholipase A2 
                                    of Naja melanoleuca venom. The twenty ligands were docked against 
                                    Phospholipase A2 protein of the snake venom retrieved from PDB via 
                                    Pyrx using AutoDock Vina. All of the ligands had binding affinities for 
                                    Phosphlipase A2, but 12 of them had stronger binding affinities with 
                                    values ranging from -7.0 to 9.0 kcal/mol. The interactions between the 
                                    ligands and the protein were assessed using BioVia. Also, the pharmacological 
                                    activities of the ligands were assessed using SwissAdme. Seven out of the twelve 
                                    ligands showed drug-likeness, however, some had low GI absorption, showed blood-brain 
                                    barrier permeability, were P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibited two or more of the 
                                    Cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. For example, 17-Hydroxyazadiradione, which had the highest 
                                    binding affinity of -9.0, exhibited drug-likeness; however, it was a P-glycoprotein 
                                    substrate and inhibited CYP3A4. Ellagic acid, with a binding affinity of -8.7, also 
                                    showed drug-likeness but only inhibited CYP1A2 of the Cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. 
                                    It was then concluded that ellagic acid is a potential ligand with inhibitory effects 
                                    on the snake venom Phospholipase protein. It was recommended that in-vitro and in-vivo 
                                    experimental studies be conducted to validate the findings made as a result of the 
                                    computational method used.

                                    <p class="text-justify" style="text-align: justify;">
                                        Snakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease that claims 
                                        over 100,000 human lives each year around the world 
                                        . It is a serious medical problem and a 
                                        health hazard that also contributes to high mortality rates in 
                                        many parts of the world, especially in tropical countries.  In 
                                        subSaharan Africa alone over 30,000 deaths occur each year as a
                                        result of the severe morbidity and mortality caused by snakebite 
                                        envenoming. In West 
                                        Africa, many times, snakebite victims must travel many hours to 
                                        the nearest medical facility, which is frequently underequipped 
                                        to handle these urgent medical situations. 
                                        Many also die within the shortest possible time because of the 
                                        high toxicity of the venom. During a snake bite, their venom is 
                                        injected into the human victim either subcutaneously or 
                                        intramuscularly. The snake venom is a complex
                                        mixture of proteins and 	enzymes 	such 	Phospholipase 	
                                        A2 	(PLA2), 	hyaluronidase, phosphomonoesterase, L-amino acid 
                                        oxidase, acetylcholinesterase, glycoprotein, low molecular weight 
                                        polypeptide, metal ions, and these molecules function as neurotoxins,
                                        myotoxins, cardiotoxins and cytotoxins. Snakes of the genus Naja are 
                                        commonly referred to as cobras. Cobras belong to the Elapidae family 
                                        and can be found in Africa and Southern Asia. In West Africa, the black 
                                        cobra, Naja melanoleuca, is one of the deadliest cobra species. The 
                                        black forest cobra is about 3m long and can produce venom yields of 
                                        more than 1g per milking. Phospholipase A2 is one of the venom 
                                        compositions of the N. melanoleuca.  Phospholipase A2 protein is 
                                        very abundant in Naja melanoleuca venom and catalyses the hydrolysis 
                                        of glycerophospholipids at the sn-2 position, releasing lysophospholipids 
                                        and fatty acids. Medicinal plants have been used as folk medicine for 
                                        treatment of snakebite. People living in rural areas as well as tribal 
                                        areas mainly depend on medicinal plants to treat snakebites. Local 
                                        healers and traditional medicine practitioners solely rely on medicinal 
                                        plants because of their safety, effectiveness, availability and affordability.
                                        One of such plants used to treat snakebite is the Neem plant. According to 
                                        Pramely and Leon (2012) each part of the Neem tree possesses some medicinal 
                                        property. Also, several parts of the Neem tree such as the leaves, bark, fruit, 
                                        flowers, oil and gum are used to treat certain medical conditions including 
                                        cancer, hypertension, heart diseases and diabetes. With the current advancement
                                        in science and modern technology, the identification and modification of specific 
                                        properties and interactions of medicinal plants is now possible. This has enabled 
                                        the identification of plant parts that are effective against certain conditions 
                                        and diseases. Also, understanding the principles by which bioactive compounds in 
                                        plants recognize and interact with proteins is of vital significance in 
                                        pharmaceutical research and drug development. The identification 
                                        and recognition of plant parts that are effective against certain conditions and 
                                        diseases involves analysis of molecular recognition events including binding 
                                        energetics, molecular interactions and induced conformational changes through 
                                        the use of molecular docking studies, structurebased virtual screening and molecular 
                                        dynamics. The interaction between the bioactive compounds in 
                                        the neem plants with the phospholipase green mamba venom through the use of the

                                        Many plants are traditionally used by local healers and 
                                        tribes in Ghana to treat various diseases and ailments. 
                                        Several plants are also known to have snake antivenom 
                                        properties, but their efficacy is frequently unproven. 
                                        One such plant is Azadirachta indica (neem), which local 
                                        healers claim has antivenom properties. Although anticancer,
                                        antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties of A. indica have 
                                        been reported in scientific literature, no literature has 
                                        been reported on its antivenom potential and properties. 
                                        The goal of this study is to figure out how bioactive 
                                        compounds in neem plants interact with phospholipase A2.

                                <p>2.1 Naja species
                                    <p class="text-justify" style="text-align: justify;">
                                        Cobras are the common name for snakes of the genus Naja. 
                                        They are members of the Elapidae family and are found in 
                                        Africa and Southern Asia. Different species of cobra have 
                                        been identified worldwide. These species of cobra are 
                                        found in variety of habitats and climate zones. The most 
                                        common Naja species that endanger human health are Naja 
                                        kaouthia, Naja oxiana, Naja naja, Naja atra, Naja 
                                        sputatrix, Naja siamensis, Naja philippinesis, Naja 
                                        sumatrana and Naja melanoleuca. Snakes from this genus 
                                        demonstrate similarities with respect to biochemical, 
                                        toxicological and antigenic properties in terms of their 
                                        venom composition. 
                                        Venoms of elapids of the genus Naja 
                                        (cobras), both African and Asian, have been thought to be 
                                        mostly active at two distinct levels: a neurotoxic level 
                                        caused primarily by post-synaptic toxins acting at 
                                        neuromuscular junctions, and a less well-understood cytotoxic 
                                        level causing tissue damage. 
                                        Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is abundant in the venom of Naja 
                                        species In Africa, Naja melanoleuca which is the black cobra 
                                        is one of the deadliest cobra species and in this work, much 
                                        attention is given to its venom composition and toxicity.

                                <p>2.2 African forest cobra (Naja melanoleuca)
                                    <p class="text-justify" style="text-align: justify;">
                                        The Forest Cobra, Naja melanoleuca, is a common forest 
                                        elapid. This species of cobra which is also referred to as 
                                        the black cobra, is an extremely venomous member in the 
                                        elapidae family. The black forest 
                                        cobra has a length of about 3m and has the capacity to 
                                        provide venom yields above 1g per milking.  The distribution 
                                        of the species is primarily tropical, confined to Africa's 
                                        tropical, subtropical, and adjacent bushes. According to 
                                        (Luiselli and Angelici 2000; Shine et al., 2007), 
                                        N. melanoleuca is the largest of the African cobra species 
                                        and it is known to live in river areas, primary and secondary 
                                        forest and suburban habitats in Western, Central, and Southern 
                                        Africa. The black forest cobra mostly feeds on mammals, frogs 
                                        and fishes. It has varying colouration and is active during 
                                        the day.

                                <p>2.3 Composition and toxicity of the venom of Naja melanoleuca
                                    <p class="text-justify" style="text-align: justify;">
                                        Due to the severity of envenoming of N. melanoleuca, it 
                                        becomes relevant to identify and know the composition of 
                                        the venom so that appropriate antivenom treatment or 
                                        therapy can be administered during envenomation. Lauridsen 
                                        et al., (2017) carried out a toxicovenomic investigation of 
                                        the venom of the forest cobra. 
                                        The results from their proteome analysis showed the presence 
                                        of 52 proteins. 
                                        These proteins mainly consist of the three-finger toxins (3FTx),
                                        which include post-synaptically active α-neurotoxins, and are the 
                                        most abundant proteins in the venom (57.1 wt%). The second most 
                                        abundant proteins in the venom are the phospholipase A2 (12.9 wt%), 
                                        followed by snake venom metalloproteinases 
                                        (SVMPs) (9.7 wt%), cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs) 
                                        (7.6 wt%), and Kunitz-type serine proteinase inhibitors (3.8 wt%). 
                                        The venom also contains other additional proteins which are less than 
                                        3 wt% (Lauridsen et al., 2017). The toxicity associated with 
                                        N. melanoleuca envenomation is a progressive descending paralysis 
                                        that begins with palpebral ptosis and, in severe cases, results in 
                                        respiratory arrest and death. Victims of N. melanoleuca experience a 
                                        descending progressive paralysis that begins with ptosis, external 
                                        ophtalmoplegia, and weakness of cranial nerve innervated muscles, 
                                        with victims having difficulty swallowing and speaking.

                                <p>2.3.1 Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) of Naja melanoleuca 
                                    <p class="text-justify" style="text-align: justify;">
                                        The enzyme phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is abundant in Naja 
                                        melanoleuca venom. The molecular weight of the protein 
                                        ranges from 11,000 Da and 15,000 Da and has amino acids 
                                        between 119 and 134. PLA2's biochemistry reveals a 
                                        catalytic site preserved in a tetrad His 48, Asp 49, 
                                        Tyr 52, and Asp 99, as well as a Ca2+-binding loop 
                                        containing Tyr 28, Gly 30, Gly 32, and Asp 99. The Asp 
                                        49 present in the catalytic site is responsible for the 
                                        high catalytic activity. PLA2 of N. melanoleuca catalyses 
                                        the hydrolysis of glycerophospholipids at the sn-2 
                                        position, releasing lysophospholipids and fatty acids. 
                                        PLA2 can cause neurotoxicity, cytotoxicity, cardiotoxicity,
                                        and haematological disorders via the leukotriene pathway 
                                        and prostaglandins. It is also 
                                        involved in the inflammatory process, which is 
                                        characterised by increased microvascular permeability, 
                                        edoema formation, leukocyte recruitment in tissues, 
                                        nociception, and the release of inflammatory mediators, 
                                        all of which cause a variety of local and systemic 
                                        inflammatory disorders.

                                    <p class="text-justify" style="text-align: justify;">
                                        The neem plant is a non-leguminous multi-purpose tree which belongs to the Meliaceae family (Adjorlolo et al., 2016). The first discovery of the plant was made about 4,500 years ago in India (Patel et al., 2016). Azadirachta indica, the scientific name for neem was taken from the Persian language and literally means 
                                    ―the free tree of India (Kumar and Navaratnam 2013). Various parts of Neem tree, including leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds and bark possess some medicinal property (Drabu and Babu, 2012; Pramely and Leon, 2012). As a result of its immense therapeutic potential, it is also known as ―Village pharmacy‖, ―Tree of the 21st century‖ and ―A tree for solving global problems‖ (Paul et al.,2011) Currently, neem tree can be found in almost every continent including Asia, Australia, North and South America and Africa. It has, however, been introduced in a number of countries around the world, including 46 African countries (Orwa et al., 2009). 
                                        According to Streets (1962) the plant was introduced in Ghana in 1915. Since then, the plant has spread throughout the country. The tree grows in most parts of the country and the dominant tree species are found in Central, Western and Eastern regions (Timpong-Jones 2011). In Ghana here, the neem tree is known to be a drought tolerant plant that thrives in areas with long dry seasons and rainfall as low as 130mm per annum (Gowda and Sastry, 2000). It is also known to grow in any type of soil and tolerate wide range of pH from 4 to 10 (Girish and Shankara, 2008). The tree (Fig 2.3) can grow to a height of about 15-20 metres and live for approximately 200 years (Kumar and Navaratnam 2013). The branches of the tree spread out widely and form an oval crown as the tree develops a deep and strong tap root. The leaves (Fig 2.4) are pinnate and green, but when the plant is young, the leaves turn purple-red. The bark is brown and fissured vertically. The fruit is small, yellow and edible (Tomar et al., 2008).

                                        Neem has therapeutics implication in either treating or preventing diseases. In recent years, neem phytoconstituents have been shown to have a wide range of biological and pharmacological activities.  These activities include, but are not limited to, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, antihistamine, antifungal, antibacterial, anti-ulcer, analgesic, anti-tubercular, anti-malarial, diuretic, spermicide, antiarthritic, anti-protozoal, insect repellant, anti-feedant, and anti-hormonal properties (Kumar and Navaratnam, 2013; Tiwari et al., 2014). Azadirachta indica extract is an important source of compounds having anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-malarial, anti-microbial and among others.

                                        The multifaceted nature of cancer makes it a huge global health issue. Changes in molecular and genetic pathways contribute to the onset and spread of cancer. Through the modification of molecular pathways, neem and its phytoconstituents contribute to the prevention of cancers (Alzohairy, 2016). The bioactive compounds isolated from neem plant have been shown unequivocally to induce apoptosis in various types of cells such as tumour cells, as well as to organise and prepare the immune system for take on cancer cells via cross priming (Rajkumar et al., 2011).  Neem phytochemicals inhibit cancer cell proliferation and growth, induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, disrupt growth factor signalling, inhibit angiogenesis, and reduce tumour cell invasion and migration (Patel et al., 2016)

                                        One of the primary causes of the development of many diseases is the free radicals or reactive oxygen species. Free radicals are, however, stabilized by antioxidants before they cause damage to biological cells (Nunes et al., 2012). Neem plants play a role in free radical scavenging activity and has been reported to possess antioxidant properties. The leaves, seeds, bark, and oil of neem are high in antioxidants. For instance, leaf and bark extracts of neem analysed by 
                                        (Sithisarn et al., 2005) clearly showed that neem possesses antioxidant properties.

                                        Extracts of neem leaves have been shown to be effective against malarial parasites. Components of the alcoholic extract of leaves have been found to be effective against both chloroquin-resistant and chloroquin-sensitive strains of the malaria parasite (Subapriya et al., 2005; Udeinya et al., 2008)

                                    <p class="text-justify" style="text-align: justify;">
                                        Azadirachta indica is rich in a wide range of compounds, of which several have pharmacological potential. According to (Subapriya and Nagini, 2005) neem contains more than 140 bioactive compounds. These bioactive compounds are classified into two groups namely isoprenoids and nonisoprenoids. Diterpenoids and triterpenoids containing protomeliacins, limonoids, azadirone and its derivatives, gedunin and its derivatives, vilasinin type compounds, and Csecomeliacins such as nimbin, salanin, and azadirachtin are examples of isoprenoids. Nonisoprenoids include proteins or amino acids, carbohydrates (polysaccharides), sulphur compounds, polyphenolics like flavonoids and their glycosides, dihydrochalcone, coumarin and tannins, aliphatic compounds, and so on. Triterpenes are the most commonly used therapeutic compounds among all of these compounds (Pramely and Raj, 2012). 
                                        The leaves are known to contain compounds such as nimbin, nimbanene, 6adesacetylnimbinene, nimbandiol, nimbolide, ascorbic acid, n hexacosanol and various amino acids, and nimbiol, among others. Nimbin, nimbanene, 6desacetylnimbinene, nimbandiol, nimbolide, ascorbic acid, n-hexacosanol and amino acid, 7-desacetyl-7-benzoylgedunin, 17-hydroxyazadiradione, and nimbiol are all found in the leaves (Kumari et al., 2020).

                                    Naja melanoleuca envenomation is a tropical disease with alarming clinical manifestations at high occurrence rates in Ghana. However, several plants are known to inhibit the venom activities of Naja melanoleuca of which Azadirachta indica plays a prominent role. Out of 20 bioactive compounds present in Azadirachta indica, 12 bioactive compounds inhibited phospholipase A2 protein in the venom of Naja melanoleuca. These compounds are 6, 7-dehydroferruginol, 
                                        7-desacetyl-7-benzoylazadiradione, 	17-Hydroxyazadiradione, 	Elagic 	acid, 
                                    Ferruginol, Gedunin, Isoquercitrin, Meliantriol, Nimbin, Nimbiol, Nimbolide and Quercetin. These compounds were identified based on results from protein-ligand interactions by virtual molecular screening in PyRx 0.8.0.0. This screening was performed to identify the ligands having the desired function to inhibit phospholipase A2 in the venom of Naja melanoleuca. Values of the binding affinities, which indicated the strength of the binding interactions between the protein and the various ligands, aided in the identification of these ligands as potent drug molecules from Azadirachta indica that can bind and inhibit the protein. Binding affinities ranging from -7.0 to -9.0 implied stronger proteinligand interactions (Table 1). 7-desacetyl-7-benzoylazadiradione and 17Hydroxyazadiradione showed the strongest binding affinity of -9.0 to 
                                    phospholipase A2.                                                   
                                        The amino acids of Phospholipase A2 which comprises Lys 6, Leu 2, Tyr 3, Trp 18, Ile 9, Ala 22 and Trp 19 which reacted with the ligand, 7-desacetyl-7benzoylazadiradione. Leu 2 interacted with the ligand through C-H-π interaction. The C-H-π interaction is a non-covalent interaction between C-H group of Leu2 and the face of an electron-rich π system of the aromatic ring of the ligand, 7desacetyl-7-benzoylazadiradione. The alkyl group of Lys 6 interacted with the pi- electron cloud over the aromatic group of the ligand, 7-desacetyl-7-
                                    benzoylazadiradione through pi-alkyl interaction. Tyr 3, Trp 18, Ile 9, Ala 22 and Trp 19 interacted with the ligand, 7-desacetyl-7-benzoylazadiradione through weak van der Waals interactions. Also, the amino acids of Phospholipase A2 which comprises Phe 5, Phe 100, Tyr 51, Phe 21, Leu 2, Trp 18, Trp 19, Ala 22, Asp 23, Gly 31, Asp 48, Tyr 27, Tyr 63, Arg 30, Cys 28, Gly 29, His 47 and Cys 
                                    44 reacted with the ligand, 17-Hydroxyazadiradione.  Phe 5, Phe 100, Tyr 51, Phe 21, Leu 2, Trp 18, Trp 19, Ala 22, Asp 23, Gly 31, Asp 48 and Tyr 27 interacted with the ligand, 17-Hydroxyazadiradione through van der Waals interactions. Tyr 63 Arg 30 interacted with the ligand, 17-Hydroxyazadiradione through conventional hydrogen bond. Cys 28 interacted with the ligand, 17Hydroxyazadiradione through Carbon-Hydrogen bond. Gly 29 interacted with the ligand, 17-Hydroxyazadiradione through pi-donor hydrogen bond. His 47 interacted with the ligand, 17-Hydroxyazadiradione through pi-pi stacked bond. 
                                    Cys 44 interacted with the ligand, 17-Hydroxyazadiradione through pi-alkyl bond.  
                                        A potent drug molecule must be able to get to its target site at a concentration that is enough to illicit its therapeutic effect before it can be accepted as a drug. It must also be bioavailable at the target site for an expected period of time. In this in silico analysis, the SwissADME aided in the prediction of physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness, which explained the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the potent molecule or drug (Daina et al., 2017).  Under pharmacokinetics, for a drug to be orally absorbed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, it must be able to withstand certain physiological conditions such as low pH and the degrading activities of some metabolizing enzymes present in the gastrointestinal tract (Jennifer Le, 2022). The ligands that showed binding affinities ranging from -7.0 to -9.0 in the molecular docking showed high absorption in the gastrointestinal tract with the exception of 7desacetyl-7-benzoylazadiradione and isoquecitrin (Table 2). This implies that about 83% of the 12 ligands will be absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract when the drug (Azadirachta indica) is administered orally. Analysis of the capacity of the ligands to cross the blood-brain barrier was also done. Considering the bloodbrain barrier (BBB), it is a cellular phospholipid protein bilayer barrier of the brain, which is highly permeable and selective. It separates the circulating blood from the extracellular fluid of the brain in the Central Nervous system (Fong, 2016). From the results of the SwissADME, 6, 7-dehydroferruginol, ferruginol and nimbiol were permeable to the blood-brain barrier. These exceptions may have the possibilities of interfering with the way neurons send, receive and process signals through neurotransmitters, therefore resulting in brain toxicity. The ability of the ligands to act as substrate for P-glycoprotein was also evaluated. The P-glycoprotein is widely distributed in intestinal epithelium which transports xenobiotic back to intestinal lumen and from capillary endothelial cells of the brain back into the capillaries (Ranjith and Ravikumar, 2019). Gedunin, meliantriol, 17-hydroxyazadiradione and nimbolide are very good substrates (Table 2), hence will not inhibit the p-glycoprotein. They can be bound and transported by this protein.

                                    P450 was also assessed. CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 (Table 3) are isoenzymes of Cytochrome P450 that metabolize more than 50-90% of xenobiotics in the liver. Inhibition of these metabolizing enzymes is an indication that a particular drug or ligand will remain in the liver for a longer period of time and cause toxicity. Gedunin, isoquercitrin, meliantriol, nimbolide and nimbin are not inhibitors of these cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. However, 7desacetyl-7-benzoylazadiradione which showed the highest binding affinity of 9.0 inhibited CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. 17-hydroxyazadiradione which also showed the highest binding affinity of -9.0 inhibited CYP3A4. Also, ellagic acid inhibited CYP1A2. The rest of the ligands inhibited either two or three of the isoenzymes.        Drug-likeness examines the probability for a molecule to become an oral drug 
                                        in 	terms 	of 	bioavailability 	(Ranjith 	and 	Ravikumar, 	2019). 	17-
                                    Hydroxyazadiradione, Ellagic acid, gedunin, meliantriol, nimbiol, nimbolide and quercetin showed drug likeness. However, these ligands; 6,7-dehydroferruginol, 7-desacetyl-7-benzoylazadiradione, Ferruginol, Isoquercitrin, Nimbin did not show drug likeness because they had either 1 or 2 violations. 
                                        To further this research, analysis was done based on the results from 
                                    SwissADME to identify the ligands that would effectively inhibit the Phospholipase A2. 7-desacetyl-7-benzoylazadiradione,17-hydroxyazadiradione, elagic acid, nimbin, and quercitin were considered based on the pharmacokinetics, physicochemical and druglikeness properties of theses ligands from the SwissADME results. 7-desacetyl-7-benzoylazadiradione had low GI absorption rate, inhibited p-glycoprotein, CYP2C9, CYP3A4 and had two violations as a drug. 17-Hydroxyazadiradione had high GI absorption rate, a good substrate to pglycoprotein, inhibited CYP 3A4 and had no violations as a drug. Elagic acid inhibited CYP1A2 and had no violations as a drug. Nimbin had one violation as a drug. Quercetin inhibited CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and had no violation.

                                    6.1 Conclusion
                                    <p class="text-justify" style="text-align: justify;">
                                        Twenty bioactive compounds of Azadirachta indica were used for the molecular docking. Out of the 20 bioactive compounds used, 12 were potent inhibitors of the Phospholipase protein of the snake venom. It be concluded that compounds present in Azadirachta indica (neem) have the potential of inhibiting Phospholipase A2 of the snake venom.

                                    <p class="text-justify" style="text-align: justify;">
                                        To narrow the research, analysis was done using SwissADME to determine the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the ligands. 17Hydroxyazadiradione having the highest binding affinity of -9.0 showed druglikeness, however, it was a substrate of P-glycoprotein and inhibited CYP3A4. Ellagic acid having a binding affinity of -8.7 also showed drug-likeness but would only inhibit CYP1A2 of the Cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. It can be concluded that ellagic acid is a potential ligand that may have inhibitory effects on the Phospholipase protein in the snake venom.

                                <p>6.2 Recommendation
                                    <p class="text-justify" style="text-align: justify;">
                                        It is important to clarify that the findings of this work cannot conclude on the inhibitory of the bioactive compounds on Phospholipase A2 of snake venom since the work was computational and only gave a prediction. It is therefore, suggested that experimental studies, both in vitro and in-vivo be conducted to validate the findings made.
